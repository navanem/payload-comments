# @navanem/payload-comments

Anonymous comments and reactions for Payload 3.x — with Markdown comment bodies, optional pre-publish
moderation, mood emojis, reactions on comments, and up to 3 levels of replies.

## Features

- Anyone can comment (name + optional/required email) with a mood emoji.
- Comment bodies support a safe subset of **Markdown** (bold, italic, code, links,
  lists, blockquotes); raw HTML is never rendered (no XSS).
- React to existing comments with a configurable emoji set.
- Optional approval workflow before comments are published — toggleable at runtime.
- Up to 3 levels of nested replies.
- Built-in lightweight anti-spam (honeypot, rate limiting, length/link rules).
- **Comments Settings** global: enable/disable comments per collection at runtime.
- **Comment Statistics** admin view: KPIs, per-collection and per-mood breakdowns, and recent comments, with filters.
- Ready-to-use `<Comments />` React component, or build your own on the REST API.

The bundled `<Comments />` component on a published page: a threaded comment with a Markdown-rendered body, a mood emoji and a date, a reaction row and a reply button, plus the composer (name, optional email, Markdown text and mood).

### Moderation (Comments collection)

Every comment lands in a standard Payload collection, so moderation uses the admin UI you already know. The list is your moderation queue — author, excerpt, a **Thread** indicator (top-level vs "↳ Reply to \<author\>"), target document, status and date — with native filtering and bulk actions; approving a pending comment publishes it instantly.

Opening a comment shows its full record — author and email, mood, the related document and threaded parent, the salted IP/fingerprint hashes used for anti-spam — and the status selector to approve, mark as spam, or trash it.

### Settings

The **Comments Settings** global toggles commenting per collection at runtime and exposes the **Require approval** switch, so you can turn mandatory pre-publish moderation on or off without a redeploy.

### Statistics

The **Comment Statistics** view: KPIs (totals by status, reaction count, per-day rate), per-collection and per-mood breakdowns, and a recent-comments table — all filterable by collection, status and period, and auth-gated server-side.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @navanem/payload-comments
# or from Git until published:
pnpm add github:navanem/payload-comments
```

`payload`, `react` and `react-dom` are peer dependencies.

## Quick start

```ts
// payload.config.ts
import { commentsPlugin } from '@navanem/payload-comments'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    commentsPlugin({
      enabledCollections: ['posts', 'pages'],
      requireApproval: true,
      requireEmail: false,
    }),
  ],
})
```

Set a salt for IP hashing in your environment:

```bash
COMMENTS_IP_SALT="a-long-random-string"
```

## Admin: Settings & Statistics

The plugin registers a **Comments Settings** global (admin group "Comments") where
an admin can toggle commenting per collection at runtime. When a collection is
disabled, new submissions are rejected and the `<Comments />` widget shows a
"closed" notice instead of the thread. Unset = every configured collection is
enabled (fail-open). The same global has a **Require approval** checkbox to turn
mandatory moderation on/off at runtime; the submit flow reads it live and falls
back to the `requireApproval` option.

It also registers a **Comment Statistics** view at `/admin/comments-statistics`
(KPIs, per-collection and per-mood breakdowns, and recent comments, filterable by
collection / status / period), plus a nav link to it via `afterNavLinks`. The view
queries moderation data server-side and is gated on an authenticated admin user.

The view and nav-link components are referenced through the host import map at the
vendored path `@/plugins/payload-comments/components/*`. If you vendor this plugin
under `src/plugins/payload-comments`, add the matching import-map entries (run
`payload generate:importmap`, or add them by hand). Hosts that ship a custom Nav
can ignore the `afterNavLinks` entry and place the Statistics link themselves.

## Front-end

```tsx
import { Comments } from '@navanem/payload-comments/client'

export default function PostPage({ post }) {
  return <Comments relationTo="posts" docId={post.id} />
}
```
